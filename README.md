ROS packages and code samples of software research projects implemented during my thesis.

Package: Katana Tutorials
Source code: follow_online_trajectory.cpp
Comments: Implementation an online kinematic trajectory tracking algorithm for the End-effector of the Katana manipulator. The input pose is calculated by a motion planning algorithm that adapts the robot motion to a constantly changing surface.
